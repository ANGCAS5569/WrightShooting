Hello!

This project is a prototype home page for an e-commerce website. This one specializes in firearms training and firearms attachments. 

I have included working links on the top of the page. The links on the main page currently do not have destinations available.

To run this app you will need to use "react-router-dom" version : "^6.0.2". This app will not run on the newer version as the "Route" component has since changed.
